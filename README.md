# I9N-I8S_water_column_characterization

Note: I9N metadata file has been manually modified for station 199 which does not exist in the downloaded CTD profiles. It was changed to 198 so that a fairly representative CTD profile could be obtained.

Therefore, the DNA / EUKfrac data are from S199, whereas the CTD data are from S198. Yubin has documented this on the GUMP repo (https://github.com/jcmcnch/GlobalUniveralMetabarcodingOfPlankton/tree/main/GO-SHIP/I8S-I9N/Associated_Measurements/0.Raw_Data)
